Choose between 1-3 of the following Challenge Questions to research on your own and answer. You can research all of the questions, but only submit answers to a max of three.

The answers are not in your lessons. These questions are intended to have you conduct additional research on your own to gain experience in finding answers for yourself. Don't look for answers in the lessons!

If some of your classmates have already submitted answers, try to choose a question/questions that have not already been answered. If they have all been answered, try to find additional information that has not yet been presented by your classmates.



Challenge Questions


Question #1: 
You've learned that a typical for loop statement begins with three parts, which can be called the initialization, the condition, and the final expression, such as:
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
Are any of these three parts optional, or are they all required? Explain.



Question #2: 
Name another array method that has not been covered and briefly explain what it does. Provide sample code.

The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.

The map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order.

Note: map() does not execute the function for array elements without values.

Note: this method does not change the original array.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Click the button to get the square root of each element in the array.</p>

<button onclick="myNumbers()">Try it</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25, 30, 36];

function myNumbers () {
  x = document.getElementById("demo")
  x.innerHTML = numbers.map(Math.sqrt);
}
</script>

</body>
</html>



Question #3 
Name another string method that has not been covered and briefly explain what it does. Provide sample code.


Question #4 
You've learned about an escape sequence \n that creates a newline in a string. Provide another example of an escape sequence, or escape characters, and explain what it does.


Question #5
You've learned that you can access the attributes of HTML elements using syntax such as: node.style.background and node.hidden. List at least two other HTML element attributes that you can access as JavaScript element node properties, and include sample code to demonstrate how you would use them in JavaScript. See this reference on W3Schools and this reference on MDN. (Note: methods end with () and properties do not.)

The blur() method is used to remove focus from an element.

Tip: Use the focus() method to give focus to an element.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
a:focus, a:active {
  color: green;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<a id="myAnchor" href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools.com</a>

<p>Click the buttons to give focus and/or remove focus from the link above.</p>

<input type="button" onclick="getfocus()" value="Get focus">
<input type="button" onclick="losefocus()" value="Lose focus">

<script>
function getfocus() {
  document.getElementById("myAnchor").focus();
}

function losefocus() {
  document.getElementById("myAnchor").blur();
}
</script>

</body>
</html>


Question #6
What is the return value from a call to node.removeChild()? What can you do with it? Show sample code to demonstrate how you might store the return value in a variable then use it. 


Question #7
What happens if you try to use the node.insertBefore() method to insert a node that already exists in the document, i.e. is already attached to the DOM? 



Question #8
Research JavaScript events such as onclick/click, onmouseover/mouseover and find one that has not been discussed during this course. Give a brief explanation of what it does. 


Question #9
You've seen how the array method sort() can be used to sort an array of strings alphabetically. What is its behavior when used to sort an array of numbers? For example, what would this array look like once sorted?: [1, 13, 1000, 29, 255]
